    <h1>My Love Letters to You</h1>

    <div class="letter">
        <h2>Love stays forever!</h2>
        <p>Vaishu!
You know you're the only person I'd lose sleep for. Do you know you're the only person I can't go a day without talking to. Like I literally can't sleep if I haven't talked to you all day. You cross my mind every single day of every second. You make me so happy, it's like all my sad days have been erased. I still love all the things you do, from the big things to the small things, I love every part of you that you show me. I really wish I could tell you how much I love you but I can't even begin to describe it. I just can't wait to show you when I see you in person. I just can't wait for the day my lips meet yours and I am able to gaze into your eyes and get lost in your soul. I want to be the shoulder you lean and cry on. I want you to be able to tell me all your secrets and how you feel, I want us to be able to break down each other's walls. Without hesitation I want you to be able to let me know when something is wrong or when you feel alone. I don't want you to feel alone anymore. I want you to know that I will always be here even if we're not talking and even when we're mad at each other. I want you to be able to come to me about all your problems and issues. You gave me a reason to wake up in the morning and be happy. When I hear your voice I just want to hug you so hard to the point where you can feel my love and feel my heart beating through my chest.
I love you üíò</p>

        <h2>Always Grateful ‚ù§</h2>
        <p>I feel incredibly blessed to have found such a complete and wonderful partner in you. I'm forever grateful for your presence in my life. No matter what challenges we may encounter, I promise to stand by your side unwaveringly. Your intelligence and smartness make you the amazing person you are today, and I admire that immensely. I love you deeply, and I can't imagine my life without you. You mean the world to me, and I'm never letting you go. üíï </p>
